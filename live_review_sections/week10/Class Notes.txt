week 10 Review Topics: Static
			   		   Static vs Instance
			   		   Inheritance

instance: belong to the object. can be called through object
			each object has it's own copy of instance

			Constructor is used for setting instance variables

static: belong to the class. can be called through the class 
		there is only one copy, shared by all objects
		
		static only accepts static 

		members:
			static variable
			static methods (if method does not involve using isntance members)
			static block: executes only one time at the very beginning
			static inner class


instance vs static:
			muliple copes vs one copy


class Circle{
	static  r;
	static PI = 3.14;

}

instance:
		3 circle object:
				r=4
				r=5
				r=6

static:
	3 ciecle objects:
			r = 5;


class iPhone{
			model;
	static	operatingSystem = "IOS"

}


class Employee{
		
		 salary;
		 jobTitle;
		static isHuman;

}


class CybertekStudents{
	
	       name;
	static schoolName

}


OOP inheritance: to build IS A relation between class (parent & child class)

			easiest way to gget rich ==> extends

			child class (sub class): can inherit all variables and methods from parent class

									cannot inherit parent' constructor (must call)

			parent class (super class): cannot inherit from child



IS A  vs HAS A:

	class Animal{
		breed, gender, color..
		sleep(), eat(), drink()
	}

	class Dog extends Animal{  // Dog Is An animal
			bark()
	}

	class Zoo{ // Zoo Has A dog
		Dog dog = new Dog();

	}



Task1:
 	create a class called Employee
        name, gender, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary
        eat(), sleep(), work(), toString()

    create a class called Tester
                    Attributes:
                        name, gender, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary
                       
                    Actions:
                         smokeTesting(),  creatingTicket(), toString()

    create a class called Developer
                    Attributes:
                        name, gender, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary

                    Actions:
                       	coding(),  fixingBug(), toString()

    create a class called ScrumTeam
                    Attributes:
                            PO, BA, SM,
                            ArrayList<Tester> testersList = new ArrayList<>(),
                            ArrayList<Developer> devopsList = new ArrayList<>(),
                            
                    
                    Add a constructor that can set PO, BA, SM

                Actions:
                    addTester(Tester tester): adds the given tester to the testers arraylist

                    addTesters(Tester[] testers): adds the given testers to the testers arraylist

                    addDeveloper(Developer developer): adds the given developer to the developers arraylist

                    addDevelopers(Developer[] developers): adds the given developers to the developers arraylist

                    removeTester(long employeeID): removes the given tester from the testers arraylist

                    removeDeveloper(long employeeID): removes the developer from the developers arraylist

                    toString(): prints number of tester,& developers,  PO name, SM name, BA name
